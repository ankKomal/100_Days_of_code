# 100_Days_of_code
Here I am going to talk about my 100_Days_of_code. 

## What is #100DaysOfCode?
#100DaysOfCode is an infamous challenge/community among developers or anybody who codes. It invloves an open commitment to code for at least 1 hour everyday! And even i also got inspired for this by one of my friend who helped me a lot in this.

## Prerequisites for my #100_Days_of_code:
```
 - Have at least 1 hour to code everyday for the next 100 days.
 - A daily organized routine of my works. 
 - GitHub account so that I can push my everyday progress on GitHub.
 ```
## What i m going to do in these #100_Days_of_code?
Since I have decided to go a bit slow , so for me this challenge is more than JUST coding.
Not necessarily be coding everyday but very necessarily be learning some tech stack.
It could be learning some language from a book, some development course, maybe making up my
own project, contributing to open source projects or simply practicing technical writing.

## Why is there a need of #100_Days_of_code for me?
```
 - I feel like I need a strickt routine or I can say a deadline for a perticular work because
   it enhances my work efficiency and ofcousrse my knowledge too. And my this #100_Days_of_code
   will definetly help me in doing so.
 - To stay disciplined. There is surely no better way to be disciplined than practicing code for 
   at least an hour everyday.
 - Enhancing my technical knowledge. Being a Computer Science student I very well understand the need of 
   enhancing my tech stacks in every direction I possibly can.
 - Building up a good coding skills.
 ```
## In my very first week of #100_Days_of_code I will be learning.
```
 - How to code in C++
 - Being consistence in problem solving platforms like HackerRank
 - Focus on Data Structure and Algorithms
 - Going in depth of Machine Learning
 - Build up some projects
 ```
# My Goals for
## Week 1 (23rd May '20 to 29th May '20)
```
 1. Setting up my #100_Days_of_code Github repository.
 2. Complete Python tutorial.
 3. Solve at least 5 questions of Python on HackerRank
 4. Complete C++ Basics
```
